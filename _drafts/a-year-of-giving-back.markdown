It's important to think about how open-source libraries are made when you use them in your projects.

They are made through the hard work of other people in the software ecosystem you live in. I am fortuante enough to be a Rails developer at a time when the ecosystem is thriving. There is literally a Ruby gem for almost anything out there.

Try this year to contribute code back to the libraries you use the most. It might end up helping yourself, and others too.

Here are some different ways to contribute to a project:

- Making a donation
- Fixing a bug
- Adding documentation
- Simply thank the maintainers (A thank you can go a long way!)
